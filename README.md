# RockPaperScissorsLizardSpock
This was a python project I did by doing the Microsoft Course  'Introduction to object-oriented programming with Python'

I acquired the knowledge and skills to utilize objects in Python, including the distinction between objects and classes. I also gained proficiency in organizing data and incorporating it into relevant class definitions.
Furthermore, I gained an understanding of the concept of encapsulation, which involves concealing data within an object and utilizing methods for communication with other objects. In Python, this is achieved through the use of prefixes on variable names to encapsulate the object's data.


The rules to the game can be seen in the matrix below:
| Choice	| Rock	|Paper	|Scissor 	|Lizard	|Spock |
| --------|:------:|-----:|--------:|------:|-----:| 
| Rock	  | 0	    |-1	    |  1	    |  1	  |   -1 |
| Paper	  | 1	    |0	    | -1	    | -1	  |    1 |
| Scissor |-1	    |1	    |  0	    |  1	  |   -1 |
| Lizard	|-1	    |1	    | -1	    |  0	  |    1 | 
| Spock	  | 1	    |-1	    |  1	    | -1	  |    0 |
